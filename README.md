#### Notes: 
This movie has a stunning animation which made immerse more to the movie. Aside from that the plot was also well made, from stand until to the end. The plot twist is really good. But I believe that the soundtrack or the background music has the biggest effect why I really love this movie. Another thing is how the movie showed the beauty of Japan. It showed various places from province to city. Overall, this show is really great if you're looking for anime movie to watch.

#### Summary:
Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside. Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture.

One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another.

Your Name revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.
